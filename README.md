# MiniEditor
This is a simple example of a C++/WinRT project for WinUI 3.  It demonstrates binding between the XAML and C++ "code behind".  The binding between the TextBoxes and code is TwoWay.  My hope is to figure out how to bind the ComboBox.SelectedIndex to a C++/WinRT Int32.  It currently works for "OneTime" binding, but I get a compiler error for "TwoWay" binding.  My question is: How to fix this?
